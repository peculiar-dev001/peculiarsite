    <h1>REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<p><b>Reproduction</b> is defined as the ability of living organisms to give rise to new individuals of the same species.It ensures the existence of that species of organism from generation to generation. It involves the fusion of the male gametes(sperm cell) and the female gamete (ova of female egg cell) to form a zygote which later develops to a young offspring.</p>
<h2>TERMS USED IN REPRODUCTION</h2>
1. FERTILIZATION
<p>The male ejects the sperms with great force into the cervix and the upper part of the female vagina.The sperms move rapidly through the cervix and uterus to the upper part of the oviduct,it releases its acrosomal enzymes when it bumps into an ovum. These enzymes are lyctic i.e they can dissolve cells and membrane.
    They help the sperm to move through the follicle cells that surround the ovum and penetrate the zona pellucida of the ovum.The sperm then moves into the ovum leaving its tail behind.As soon as the sperm enters an ovum, the zona pellucida undergoes changes that prevent other sperms from penetrating the ovum. Thus, although millions of sperms are injected during copulation ,only one sperm finally fertilizes an ovum.
    </p>
2. PREGNANCY/ GESTATION
<p>The zygote divides into <i>two halves</i>. These then continue to divide to form a solid ball of cells. This soon becomes a hollow ball filled with fluid. A knob of cells form at one side within this ball. This gives rise to the embryo. All these development takes place within <b>seven (7) days</b> after fertilization<b> (around 14-21 days of the menstrual cycle).</b>
    As the embryo grows, the uterus becomes bigger to contain it. All the major organs are formed in the embryo by the end of<b> 10-12 weeks.</b> From this stage onwards, the human embryo is known as <b><i>FOETUS</b></i>.As the foetus grow, it becomes active . By the end of <b>16 weeks,</b> the mother can usually feel the baby move.<b>In humans, the gestation period is 36 weeks</b>
</p>      
    <h3>   Trimesters of pregnancy   </h3>
    <p>
        A pregnancy is divided into three trimesters;each about 3 months or 13 weeks long totaling approximately 40 weeks.
        <br>
    
        a. First trimesters  (weeks 1-12)
    <ul>
        <li> <i>Fetal development</i>: The baby's basic  body structure and organ system develops
        <li> <i>Parental experience</i>: Common symptoms include fatigue,nausea,breast tenderness and frequent urination.
        <li> <i>Importance</i>: This is a crucial time for fetal development and many miscarriages and birth defects can occur during this period.
        </ul>
    b. Second trimester (week 13-26) 
    <ul>
        <li><i>Parental experience</i> : Early symptoms like nausea may disappear, and you may feel more energy. Some new discomfort may arise such as back pain, constipation or heart burn.
        <li><i>Milestone</i>: Ultra sound can determine the baby's gender during this period.
        </ul>
    c. Third trimester (weeks 27-40)
    <ul>
        <li><i>Fetal development</i>: The fetus grow rapidly and gain weight, positioning itself for birth.
        <li><i>Parental experience</i>:Shortness of breath, lower back pain, increase need to urinate, difficulty in sleeping 
        <li><i>Preparation</i>:The baby drops into your pelvis preparing for delivery
        </ul>
    3. PLACENTA    
      <p>
        This is a disc-shaped structure composed of material tissue<i> (uterine endometrium) </i>and embryonic tissue.
        It is connected to the foetus by a cord called the <b>umblical cord</b> that carries umblical artery and vein from the foetus.Trophoblast(a thin barrier the maternal and foetal blood supplies) allows exchange of materials between them(oxygen and nutrients).
        Certain maternal antibodies also pass into the foetus providing it with immunity against the associated diseases.About 8 weeks after fertilization,the placenta becomes the main producer of progesterone and oestrogen.These hormones maintain the uterine endometrium throughout the rest of the pregnancy.
     </p>
    4. BIRTH   
       <p>
        The actual process of birth involves the following stages:
        <br>
        (i) The dilation of the cervix to allow the head to pass through which leads to bleeding  called<b><i> 'show'</b></i>
        <br>
        (ii) The rupture of the amnion with fluid escaping through the vagina to the exterior also known as breaking of water bag
        <br> 
        (iii) The expulsion of the foetus through the dilated cervix and vagina by the forceful contractions of the uterine and abdominal muscles
        <br>
        (iv) The expulsion of placenta after birth
        </p>
        <h4>The expulsion of Placenta(after birth)</h4>
        <p> Multiple birth: A woman releases one mature ovum from an ovary each month so that if fertilization occurs, \
            only one baby is born at the end of each pregnancy.
            <ul>
                <li>Identical twin: A fertilized ovum divides into two identical calls which develop into two separate embryos. Both embryo share at the same placenta
                <li>Fracternal twins: Sometimes a woman releases two ova the same times, each ova develop into an embryo when fertilized with its own placenta
                <li>Test-tube babies: couples who cant conceive a child can adopt a method called in-vitro-fertilasation
                </ul>        
    5. LACTATION:During pregnancy, progesterone and oestrogen cause the milk glands to develop in the mother's breast.
    The anterior lobe of the pituiary releases ahormone, prolaction, which stimulates milk production after birth.
    <h4 style="height: 25px;">REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH</h4>
    1.Contraception:is a method used to prevent pregnancy and manage sexual and reproductive health.Types of contraceptive methods include;
    <br>
    i. Barrier method: Physically blocks sperm from reaching the egg e.g male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps.
    <br>
    ii. Hormonal methods: Use hormones to prevent ovulation,thicken cervical mucus or thin the uterine lining e.g
    <ul>
        <li>The Patch: worn on the skin and changed weekly.</li>

        <li>Injectables(Depo-provera):injections given every 3 months.</li>
        <li>Implants (Nexplanon):a small rod inserted under the skin of the upper arm effective for several use.</li>
    </ul>
    iii.IUD(INTRA UTERINE DEVICES):Small devices inserted into the uterus e.g 
    <ul>
        <li>Hormonal IUDs:Release progestin effective for 3-8 years</li>
        <li>Copper IUDs:Non hormonal, create an inflammatory reaction toxic to sperm and eggs effective for up to 10 years</li>
    </ul>
    iv.Permanent method(sterilization)e.g 
    <ul>
        <li>Tubal ligation(females):tying the tubes</li>
        <li>Vasectomy(males):Cutting or sealing the Vas deferens</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    ii.<i>Testicular cancer</i>:this cancer is formed in the testicles(testes),which are located in the scrotum and produce male hormones and sperm.

    <br>
    i.<i>Cervical Cancer</i>:This start in the cervix,the lower part of the uterus that connects to the virgina.It is always caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV(Human Ppillomavirus).It weakens the immune system and it is a common sexually transmitted infection(STI) that can affect both men and women. 
    Symptoms include abnormal virgina bleeding, unusual virgina discharge etc.
    <br>

    <br>
    5.Menopause:Is the permanent cessation of menstruation,resulting from the loss of ovarian follicular activity.The average is around 51 years but it can occur anytime between the ages of 40 and 58.
    It is caused by natural decline in the function of the ovaries.
    <br>

    2.Menopause:The point in time 12 months after a woman's last menstrual period.
    <br>
    3.Postmenopause:The years following menopause.Women remain at high risk for health condition due to lower estrogen levels.
    <br>
    <h9 style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Common Symptoms of Menopause</b></h9>
    <br>
      i.Hot flashes and night sweat
